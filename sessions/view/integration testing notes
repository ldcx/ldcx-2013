capybara/webkit unreliable?
selenium-webdriver: better, but you need to keep track of firefox version






integration testing: 
* use i18n: it lets your test and view be connected, because you're looking for the same string, but is this too brittle?
* should i18n
  
  
how to interact with end users:
* what level of nitpickyness
* how much to let them into the process
  


usability testing:
* focus groups
* don't let the developer speak
  
  
tracking people:
* add information like browser, page they were on
* mouseflow ( http://mouseflow.com/ )
  
cute analytics tricks:
* section off people based on whether they're staff or not.
* video engagement analytics


writing view/integration tests ahead of time is tough if you're not doing wireframes, but you can do very simple wireframes


using mocks of external services is really useful
don't mock the framework you're including
vcd caches sold results and other externals
